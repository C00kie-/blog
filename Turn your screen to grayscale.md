##Linux

A lot of time on the screens can lead to significant cognitive overload. Fatigue does not come initially from the eyes, but from the brain.
The idea here is to reduce the imputation of information that you receive visually by removing the colors.

First install required package

      sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell 

Then, reboot your navigator (Firefox here)

Go to : https://extensions.gnome.org and search for "desaturate", select Desaturate All and click on the right side of your navigator windows to activate it.

A pop-up window asks you if you want to install it, click "Yes"

Once installed, you'll see a little icon of a palette on your gnome navigation bar, click on it and "bam"

You are all set.
